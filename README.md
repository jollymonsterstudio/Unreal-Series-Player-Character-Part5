# Unreal C++ Tutorial 
### Player Character Series – Punch – Part 5 - Play Sounds

Hey guys,

This is the fifth video our Player Character series taking about sounds.

The topics we are going to cover in this tutorial are:
* [USoundCue - 01:30](https://youtu.be/LT9xAPOp03Y?t=91) - we are going to attach our WAV file to a sound cue and bring that into our code.
* [UAudioComponent - 08:10](https://youtu.be/LT9xAPOp03Y?t=491) - we are then going to tie our sound cue to our audio component to be able to handle playback.
* [Playing sounds - 12:50](https://youtu.be/LT9xAPOp03Y?t=768) - we are going trigger the playing of the sound and adjusting it's pitch to introduce a bit of variance.
